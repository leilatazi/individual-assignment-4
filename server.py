#In this exercise we will create an HTTP server to which we can upload a
#graph and in which we can get the degrees of separation between two nodes
#in the graph.

#1. Create a route in the server to which the user can upload a graph using
#JSON and using the POST http method. 

#The JSON data should be passed as part of the request body, not in the URL.

#2. Create a route to get the degrees of separation between two nodes in
#the previously uploaded graph.

#localhost:5000/degrees_of_separation/<origin>/<destination>.

#You can use any code we want from the exercises weâ€™ve done in class
#related to graphs.

#%%
